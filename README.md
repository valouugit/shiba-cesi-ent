Shiba-Judge is a Discord bot, created by the great, the unique, the magnificent, what shall I say, the overpowered``Valouu``!

Its goal is to allow CESI students to have a direct access to their grade by a simple command.
No more wasted time, that's the promise that Valouu makes to us:


> "Students will no longer have to take the time to connect to the ent, 
> 
>  to download a document that they will end up deleting. In one click, they will see their grades!"
